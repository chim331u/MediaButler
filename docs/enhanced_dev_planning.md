# MediaButler Development Planning Document - Enhanced

## Project Overview

**MediaButler** is an intelligent media file organization system that automatically classifies and organizes video files (TV shows, movies) using machine learning. The system monitors a watch folder, analyzes filenames, and moves files to appropriate library locations.

### Vision
Transform chaotic media downloads into a perfectly organized library through intelligent automation, following Rich Hickey's "Simple Made Easy" philosophy.

### Core Principles (Simple Made Easy)
1. **Simple vs Easy**: Choose simple (un-braided, one-fold) solutions over familiar ones
2. **Avoid Complecting**: Keep concerns separate - no braiding of disparate concepts
3. **Compose, Don't Complex**: Place independent components together without intertwining
4. **Values Over State**: Prefer immutable data and explicit state management
5. **Declarative Over Imperative**: Describe what, not how
6. **Artifact Over Construct**: Judge tools by the simplicity of what they produce

---

## Enhanced Development Strategy

### **Performance-Driven Development (PDD) Pattern**

#### **Daily Performance Budget**
Every development task must validate against these constraints:
```
Memory Usage: <300MB (validated every build)
API Response Time: <100ms (validated every endpoint)
ML Classification: <500ms (validated every model change)
UI Responsiveness: <200ms (validated every component)
File Operation: Progress updates every 100ms
```

#### **Performance Validation Workflow**
1. **Before Implementation**: Establish baseline metrics
2. **During Development**: Continuous performance monitoring
3. **Before Commit**: Performance regression check
4. **Sprint Review**: Performance trend analysis

#### **Performance Testing Integration**
- **BenchmarkDotNet** for micro-benchmarks in unit tests
- **Memory profilers** integrated into CI pipeline
- **Load testing** for file processing workflows
- **ARM32 validation** for all performance-critical components

### **"Simple Made Easy" Validation Framework**

#### **Simplicity Gates Per Sprint**
Before proceeding to next sprint, validate:

**Architectural Simplicity Checklist:**
- [ ] **No Complecting**: Can each component be understood in isolation?
- [ ] **Composable Design**: Can components be recombined for different use cases?
- [ ] **Values Over State**: Are state changes explicit and minimal?
- [ ] **Declarative Intent**: Is the "what" clear without understanding "how"?
- [ ] **Single Responsibility**: Does each class/service have exactly one reason to change?

#### **Architectural Decision Records (ADRs)**
Document every choice that affects simplicity:

**ADR Template:**
```markdown
# ADR-XXX: [Decision Title]

## Status: [Proposed/Accepted/Deprecated]

## Context
What forces led to this decision?

## Decision
What did we decide?

## Consequences
How does this maintain/improve simplicity?
What complexity does this introduce?
How does this align with "Simple Made Easy"?
```

**Example ADRs to Create:**
- ADR-001: Why minimal APIs over controllers?
- ADR-002: Why vertical slices over layered architecture?
- ADR-003: Why SQLite over PostgreSQL for this use case?
- ADR-004: Why FastText over deep learning models?

### **User Feedback Integration Loop**

#### **User Validation Gates**
Each sprint includes user validation checkpoints:

**Sprint 1 → 2 Validation Gate**
**Question**: "Can I see my files being tracked?"
**Demo**: API showing scanned files with status
**Success Criteria**: User understands file states without technical knowledge
**Validation Method**: Show file list with clear status indicators
**Decision Point**: Continue to ML implementation or refine file tracking UX

**Sprint 2 → 3 Validation Gate**
**Question**: "Is the classification making sense?"
**Demo**: ML classification results with confidence scores
**Success Criteria**: User can correct wrong classifications intuitively
**Validation Method**: Present 10 classified files, measure correction accuracy
**Decision Point**: Proceed to file movement or improve classification accuracy

**Sprint 3 → 4 Validation Gate**
**Question**: "Can I safely organize my files?"
**Demo**: File movement with rollback capability
**Success Criteria**: User trusts the system won't lose data
**Validation Method**: Demonstrate rollback of file operations
**Decision Point**: Build web UI or enhance safety mechanisms

**Sprint 4 → Release Validation Gate**
**Question**: "Does this replace my manual workflow?"
**Demo**: Complete workflow from scan to organized library
**Success Criteria**: User prefers automated system to manual process
**Validation Method**: Time comparison and user satisfaction survey
**Decision Point**: Release v1.0 or iterate on user experience
