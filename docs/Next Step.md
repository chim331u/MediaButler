merge web_analysis_panning_complete.md/9. Implementation Plan & Roadmap in dev_planning.md/SPRINT 4: Web Interface & User Experience (Days 13-16)

Increase test coverage task 1.7.1

Suggestions to improve Claude Code:
```

Use the phrase “Prepare to discuss.” This lets Claude Code build up context before jumping into code.

Build and reuse context with Double Escape and Resume. When you reach a “smart” state, fork it into new tabs and tasks. This saves time and keeps consistency across PRs.

Plan in PR-sized chunks. Ask for function names, short descriptions, and test names. Then implement chunk by chunk with linting, compiling, and tests to keep the feedback loop tight.

Run a planner vs. developer split. Use one session to plan and critique, another to implement. Have the planner review the developer’s steps and provide concrete feedback. Tip: use the phrase “my developer” so Claude doesn’t assume it is critiquing its own code.

Avoid Compact. If the window gets messy, rewind to a clean earlier state instead of patching bad context. Always restart from a good checkpoint.
