# Learning Loop Integration
## Claude Agent Concept

### Proposed Agent: "DevPlan Optimizer"
A specialized Claude agent that:

- Reviews completed sprints against original planning
- Identifies patterns in what worked vs. what didn't
- Updates dev_planning.md with learnings and adjustments
- Suggests architectural improvements based on "Simple Made Easy" principles

### Agent Inputs:

- Sprint completion reports
- Code complexity metrics
- Performance benchmark results
- User feedback from validation gates

### Agent Outputs:

- Updated sprint plans based on learnings
- Architectural decision recommendations
- Risk mitigation strategy adjustments
- "Simple Made Easy" compliance reports

# Future-Proofing 
## Claude Agent Concept
   
### Proposed Agent: "Architecture Guardian"
A specialized Claude agent that:

- Monitors architectural decisions for future extensibility
- Validates "Simple Made Easy" principles are maintained
- Suggests refactoring when complexity emerges
- Plans extension points without over-engineering

Agent Outputs
1. Architectural Health Report
```
   # MediaButler Architecture Health Report - Sprint X
   Date: 2024-01-15
   Status: [HEALTHY/NEEDS_ATTENTION/CRITICAL]

## Simplicity Score: 8.5/10
- Cyclomatic Complexity: 7.2 avg (target <8)
- Dependency Violations: 0 (target 0)
- Complecting Issues: 1 minor identified
- Configuration Complexity: Low

## Key Findings
✅ Clean separation between ML and Domain layers maintained
⚠️  FileService beginning to accumulate multiple responsibilities  
✅ Database layer remains simple and focused
✅ API layer maintains single purpose per endpoint

## Recommendations
1. Consider splitting FileService into FileManager + FileValidator
2. Extract configuration validation to separate component
3. Document natural extension points for future mobile client
```

2. Refactoring Recommendations
```
# Refactoring Recommendations - Priority Ordered

## HIGH PRIORITY
### Split FileService Responsibilities
**Issue**: FileService handling both CRUD and business validation
**Simple Made Easy Violation**: Complecting data access with business logic
**Suggested Refactoring**:
- Extract IFileValidator interface for business rules
- Keep FileService focused on CRUD operations only
- Maintain composability between components

## MEDIUM PRIORITY
### Simplify Configuration Validation
**Issue**: Configuration validation scattered across multiple services
**Simple Made Easy Violation**: Validation logic complected with service logic
**Suggested Refactoring**:
- Create ConfigurationValidator as separate concern
- Use declarative validation rules vs imperative validation
- Centralize validation to eliminate duplication
```
3. Future Extension Point Documentation
```# Extension Points Analysis - MediaButler

## Identified Extension Points (DO NOT BUILD YET)
### 1. Classification Algorithm Pluggability
**Current**: FastText implementation embedded in ML service
**Extension Point**: IClassificationAlgorithm interface
**Future Value**: Allow A/B testing different ML models
**Implementation Complexity**: Low - interface extraction
**When to Build**: When second algorithm needed

### 2. File Organization Strategies
**Current**: Flat folder structure hardcoded
**Extension Point**: IOrganizationStrategy interface
**Future Value**: User-configurable organization patterns
**Implementation Complexity**: Medium - strategy pattern
**When to Build**: When users request different organization styles

## RED FLAGS - DO NOT BUILD
❌ Generic plugin architecture - no current need identified
❌ Multi-user authentication system - single user requirement
❌ Distributed processing - ARM32 single-node constraint
```
4. Architectural Decision Reviews
```# ADR Review - Recent Decisions

## ADR-005: Minimal APIs vs Controllers - APPROVED ✅
**Decision**: Use Minimal APIs for MediaButler endpoints
**Simple Made Easy Alignment**: Reduces ceremony, focuses on data flow
**Extension Impact**: Easy to add new endpoints, maintains simplicity
**Recommendation**: Continue with this pattern

## ADR-006: Entity Framework vs Dapper - NEEDS REVIEW ⚠️
**Decision**: Entity Framework Core for data access  
**Complexity Concern**: EF adds significant abstraction layers
**Performance Impact**: Additional memory overhead on ARM32
**Recommendation**: Benchmark against Dapper for ARM32 performance
**Action**: Create spike to compare memory usage and query performan
