merge web_analysis_panning_complete.md/9. Implementation Plan & Roadmap in dev_planning.md/SPRINT 4: Web Interface & User Experience (Days 13-16)

Increase test coverage task 1.7.1

Suggestions to improve Claude Code:
```

Use the phrase “Prepare to discuss.” This lets Claude Code build up context before jumping into code.

Build and reuse context with Double Escape and Resume. When you reach a “smart” state, fork it into new tabs and tasks. This saves time and keeps consistency across PRs.

Plan in PR-sized chunks. Ask for function names, short descriptions, and test names. Then implement chunk by chunk with linting, compiling, and tests to keep the feedback loop tight.

Run a planner vs. developer split. Use one session to plan and critique, another to implement. Have the planner review the developer’s steps and provide concrete feedback. Tip: use the phrase “my developer” so Claude doesn’t assume it is critiquing its own code.

Avoid Compact. If the window gets messy, rewind to a clean earlier state instead of patching bad context. Always restart from a good checkpoint.
```

New Dev Semplified:

SPRINT 3: File Operations & Automation - SIMPLIFIED
Theme: Safe, atomic file operations with minimal complexity
Goal: Reliable file organization with clear rollback capabilities
Duration: Days 9-12 (4 days, 32 hours total)
Core Simplification Principles
1. Eliminate Over-Engineering
Current plan has 4 separate sub-sprints with overlapping concerns. Simplified approach:

Combine file watching with discovery (they're the same concern)
Merge organization logic with file operations (atomic operations)
Remove separate "automation testing" - integrate with implementation

2. Focus on Essential Safety

File operations must be atomic and reversible
Progress tracking for user confidence
Clear error handling without complex state machines

3. Reduce Moving Parts

Single file operation service instead of multiple engines
Simple state-based approach instead of complex pipelines
Direct integration with existing domain events

Separate "transaction management" layer
Complex "pipeline" abstractions
Separate "naming convention engine"
Independent "progress tracking" service

Kept Simple:

Structured logging infrastructure

4. Atomic Operations Over Transactions
Philosophy: Use OS-level atomic file operations instead of application-level transaction management

Directory creation with proper error handling
Simple rollback: move file back to original location

5. Error Handling Without State Machines
Simple Error Strategy:

Classify errors into actionable categories

ARCHITECTURAL BENEFITS OF SIMPLIFICATION
1. Maintainability

Fewer moving parts to understand and debug
Clear service boundaries aligned with business operations
Leverages existing, tested infrastructure

2. Testability

Simpler integration tests with fewer mock dependencies
Clear test scenarios mapping to user workflows

Reuse of existing services reduces memory footprint

This simplified Sprint 3 maintains all essential safety and functionality requirements while following "Simple Made Easy" principles more strictly. The reduction in complexity should make implementation faster and more reliable while still achieving the core goal of safe, automated file organization.
