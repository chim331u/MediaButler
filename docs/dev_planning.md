# MediaButler Development Planning Document

## Project Overview

**MediaButler** is an intelligent media file organization system that automatically classifies and organizes video files (TV shows, movies) using machine learning. The system monitors a watch folder, analyzes filenames, and moves files to appropriate library locations.

### Vision
Transform chaotic media downloads into a perfectly organized library through intelligent automation, following Rich Hickey's "Simple Made Easy" philosophy.

### Core Principles (Simple Made Easy)
1. **Simple vs Easy**: Choose simple (un-braided, one-fold) solutions over familiar ones
2. **Avoid Complecting**: Keep concerns separate - no braiding of disparate concepts
3. **Compose, Don't Complex**: Place independent components together without intertwining
4. **Values Over State**: Prefer immutable data and explicit state management
5. **Declarative Over Imperative**: Describe what, not how
6. **Artifact Over Construct**: Judge tools by the simplicity of what they produce
