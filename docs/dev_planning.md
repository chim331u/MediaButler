1.5 requirements# MediaButler Development Planning Document

## Project Overview

**MediaButler** is an intelligent media file organization system that automatically classifies and organizes video files (TV shows, movies) using machine learning. The system monitors a watch folder, analyzes filenames, and moves files to appropriate library locations.

### Vision
Transform chaotic media downloads into a perfectly organized library through intelligent automation, following Rich Hickey's "Simple Made Easy" philosophy.

### Core Principles (Simple Made Easy)
1. **Simple vs Easy**: Choose simple (un-braided, one-fold) solutions over familiar ones
2. **Avoid Complecting**: Keep concerns separate - no braiding of disparate concepts
3. **Compose, Don't Complex**: Place independent components together without intertwining
4. **Values Over State**: Prefer immutable data and explicit state management
5. **Declarative Over Imperative**: Describe what, not how
6. **Artifact Over Construct**: Judge tools by the simplicity of what they produce

---

## Enhanced Development Strategy

### **Performance-Driven Development (PDD) Pattern**

#### **Daily Performance Budget**
Every development task must validate against these constraints:
```
Memory Usage: <300MB (validated every build)
API Response Time: <100ms (validated every endpoint)
ML Classification: <500ms (validated every model change)
UI Responsiveness: <200ms (validated every component)
File Operation: Progress updates every 100ms
```

#### **Performance Validation Workflow**
1. **Before Implementation**: Establish baseline metrics
2. **During Development**: Continuous performance monitoring
3. **Before Commit**: Performance regression check
4. **Sprint Review**: Performance trend analysis

#### **Performance Testing Integration**
- **BenchmarkDotNet** for micro-benchmarks in unit tests
- **Memory profilers** integrated into CI pipeline
- **Load testing** for file processing workflows
- **ARM32 validation** for all performance-critical components

### **"Simple Made Easy" Validation Framework**

#### **Simplicity Gates Per Sprint**
Before proceeding to next sprint, validate:

**Architectural Simplicity Checklist:**
- [ ] **No Complecting**: Can each component be understood in isolation?
- [ ] **Composable Design**: Can components be recombined for different use cases?
- [ ] **Values Over State**: Are state changes explicit and minimal?
- [ ] **Declarative Intent**: Is the "what" clear without understanding "how"?
- [ ] **Single Responsibility**: Does each class/service have exactly one reason to change?

#### **Architectural Decision Records (ADRs)**
Document every choice that affects simplicity:

**ADR Template:**
```markdown
# ADR-XXX: [Decision Title]

## Status: [Proposed/Accepted/Deprecated]

## Context
What forces led to this decision?

## Decision
What did we decide?

## Consequences
How does this maintain/improve simplicity?
What complexity does this introduce?
How does this align with "Simple Made Easy"?
```

**Example ADRs to Create:**
- ADR-001: Why minimal APIs over controllers?
- ADR-002: Why vertical slices over layered architecture?
- ADR-003: Why SQLite over PostgreSQL for this use case?
- ADR-004: Why FastText over deep learning models?

### **User Feedback Integration Loop**

#### **User Validation Gates**
Each sprint includes user validation checkpoints:

**Sprint 1 → 2 Validation Gate**
**Question**: "Can I see my files being tracked?"
**Demo**: API showing scanned files with status
**Success Criteria**: User understands file states without technical knowledge
**Validation Method**: Show file list with clear status indicators
**Decision Point**: Continue to ML implementation or refine file tracking UX

**Sprint 2 → 3 Validation Gate**
**Question**: "Is the classification making sense?"
**Demo**: ML classification results with confidence scores
**Success Criteria**: User can correct wrong classifications intuitively
**Validation Method**: Present 10 classified files, measure correction accuracy
**Decision Point**: Proceed to file movement or improve classification accuracy

**Sprint 3 → 4 Validation Gate**
**Question**: "Can I safely organize my files?"
**Demo**: File movement with rollback capability
**Success Criteria**: User trusts the system won't lose data
**Validation Method**: Demonstrate rollback of file operations
**Decision Point**: Build web UI or enhance safety mechanisms

**Sprint 4 → Release Validation Gate**
**Question**: "Does this replace my manual workflow?"
**Demo**: Complete workflow from scan to organized library
**Success Criteria**: User prefers automated system to manual process
**Validation Method**: Time comparison and user satisfaction survey
**Decision Point**: Release v1.0 or iterate on user experience

- Rapid development maintained high code quality despite initial test issues
- Configuration enhancements resolved many underlying dependency problems
- Comprehensive service implementation created stable foundation

### Performance Targets
- **Memory Usage**: <300MB under normal load
- **API Response Time**: <100ms (95th percentile)
- **ML Classification**: <500ms per file

- **Test Coverage**: >82% line coverage maintained
- **Cyclomatic Complexity**: <10 per method average
- **Code Duplication**: <5% across solution
- **Documentation**: 100% public API documented
- **Architecture**: Zero circular dependencies

### "Simple Made Easy" Validation
- **Separation of Concerns**: Each project has single responsibility
- **No Complecting**: Domain, ML, File Operations, UI are independent
- **Composable Design**: Components can be used independently
- **Declarative Configuration**: What, not how, in settings
- **Immutable Values**: State changes are explicit and tracked

## Risk Management

### Technical Risks by Sprint
**Sprint 1**: Database migration complexity, Repository pattern over-abstraction ✅ **MITIGATED: 243 tests passing**
**Sprint 2**: ML model accuracy, Training data quality, Performance under load ✅ **COMPLETE**  
**Sprint 3**: **SIMPLIFIED RISKS** - File system permissions, Cross-platform compatibility, Data loss scenarios (REDUCED: No complex transaction management, no over-abstracted pipelines)
**Sprint 4**: Real-time update complexity, Mobile responsiveness, Browser compatibility

### Mitigation Strategies
- **Early Testing**: Comprehensive test coverage from day 1
- **Simple Designs**: Avoid over-engineering and complex patterns
- **Incremental Integration**: Test each layer independently before integration
- **Performance Monitoring**: Continuous performance validation
- **Rollback Capabilities**: Every operation must be reversible

#### **Sprint 1 User Validation Gate - ENHANCED WITH OPERATIONAL VALIDATION**
**After Task 1.7.8 - Before Sprint 2**

**User Question**: "Can I see my files being tracked and understand what's happening in the system?"

**Demo Preparation**:
1. Set up test environment with sample video files
2. Configure API endpoints for file listing and status
3. Prepare demonstration of file discovery and status tracking
4. **NEW**: Set up operational monitoring dashboard showing system health
5. **NEW**: Prepare demonstration of troubleshooting capabilities

**Demo Script**:
```
1. Show watch folder with sample files
2. Trigger file scan via API
3. Display tracked files with status indicators
4. Show file metadata and processing state
5. Demonstrate filtering and search capabilities
6. NEW: Show system health dashboard with real-time metrics
7. NEW: Demonstrate error scenario and how system provides troubleshooting info
8. NEW: Show log correlation and tracing capabilities
```

**Success Criteria**:
- User understands different file states without explanation
- File information is presented clearly and logically
- User can identify which files need attention
- System status is transparent and trustworthy
- **NEW**: User feels confident they could troubleshoot issues independently
- **NEW**: System health information is actionable and understandable
- **NEW**: Performance information builds confidence in system reliability

**Validation Questions for User**:
1. "Looking at this file list, can you tell which files are ready for processing?"
2. "What would you expect to happen if you click on a file?"
3. "Does the file status make sense to you?"
4. "Are you confident the system has found all your files?"
5. **NEW**: "Looking at the system health information, do you understand if the system is working well?"
6. **NEW**: "If something went wrong, do you feel you'd have enough information to figure out what happened?"
7. **NEW**: "Does the performance information help you trust that the system will work reliably?"

**Decision Point**:
- **✅ PASS**: User comfortably navigates file tracking AND trusts operational transparency → Proceed to Sprint 2
- **❌ NEEDS WORK**: Confusion about file states OR lack of confidence in system observability → Refine UX and operational visibility before ML implementation
