## Overview

MediaButler's ML evaluation system provides comprehensive accuracy reporting through the `IModelEvaluationService`. The system generates detailed metrics that help understand model performance, stability, and readiness for production deployment on ARM32 environments.

### Key Report Types

1. **Accuracy Metrics Report**: Overall and per-category performance
2. **Confusion Matrix**: Detailed classification breakdown
3. **Confidence Analysis**: Model calibration and reliability
4. **Cross-Validation Results**: Stability and consistency metrics
5. **Performance Benchmarks**: Speed and resource usage
6. **Quality Assessment**: Production readiness evaluation

## Accuracy Metrics Explained

### Core Metrics

#### Overall Accuracy
```
Overall Accuracy = Correct Predictions / Total Predictions
```
- **Target**: ≥85% for production deployment
- **ARM32 Consideration**: Balance accuracy vs model size (20MB limit)

#### Precision (Per Category)
```
Precision = True Positives / (True Positives + False Positives)
```
- Measures how many predicted categories were actually correct
- High precision = few false alarms

#### Recall (Per Category)
```
Recall = True Positives / (True Positives + False Negatives)
```
- Measures how many actual instances were correctly identified
- High recall = few missed classifications

#### F1-Score (Per Category)
```
F1-Score = 2 × (Precision × Recall) / (Precision + Recall)
```
- Harmonic mean of precision and recall
- Balances both metrics for comprehensive evaluation

#### Macro vs Weighted Averages
- **Macro Average**: Unweighted average across all categories
- **Weighted Average**: Average weighted by category support (sample count)

#### Medium Confidence (0.5-0.8)
- Require human review
- Good candidates for active learning
- Consider ensemble methods

#### Low Confidence (<0.5)
- Manual classification needed
- Likely new or unusual content
- Add to training data
